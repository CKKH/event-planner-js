Event Planner 
=============
Test driving a single paged javascript web app with a custom testing framework

## User Stories
---------------
```
As a user
So I can let people know about an event
I can post an event with a name

As a user
So I can let people know more about an event
I can provide more information when I post an event

As a user
So I can let people know when an event I post will take place
I can provide date time details when I post an event

As a user
So I can find out about all events posted
I can see a list of events with their details

As an admin
So the event planner doesn't clog up
Only upcoming events stay listed on my webapp

As a user
So I know which events are happening soon
I want to see the list of events in chronological order
